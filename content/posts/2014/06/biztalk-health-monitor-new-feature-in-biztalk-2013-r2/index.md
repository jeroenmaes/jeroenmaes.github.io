BizTalk 2013 R2 is soon to be released to the public and can be seen as a (minor) platform update in the first place. Besides this, there are also updates to some adapters. An overview can be found here on MSDN: [What's New in BizTalk Server 2013 and 2013 R2](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj248703(v=bts.80).aspx).

Except the support for JSON on the WCF-WebHttp adapter, we cannot expect anything spectacular in my opinion. Or is it…?

An exciting new feature that isn’t mentioned on MSDN anywhere, is the BizTalk Health Monitor:

BizTalk Health Monitoring groups a number of already existing elements into the BizTalk Management Console. Some features that I was able to spot:

- Integration of the MessageBox Viewer tool
- Performance analysis thanks to integrated PerfMon
- Eeasy SQL Job Status monitoring
- Automatic Archiving of Health reports
