Recently I came across an excellent talk from Devoxx 2019: Qualities of a Highly Effective Architect by Venkat Subramaniam.

In this talk, Venkat discusses 12 qualities an effective architect should have. Also, he mentions an old article by Martin Fawler called "[Who needs an architect](http://files.catwell.info/misc/mirror/2003-martin-fowler-who-needs-an-architect.pdf)".

Both the talk and the article are great resources to understand what an architect is and what qualities he should possess.
